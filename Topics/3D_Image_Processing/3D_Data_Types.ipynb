    "This is similar to the 2D Pixel representation of an image where each pixel is a square in a 2D Image but here we have 3D cubes. \n",
    "#### 2. Meshes\n",
    "Surface representation using vertices and faces. Examples - STL, OBJ Models\n",
    "#### 3. Point Clouds\n",
    "There are just a set of unordered points that will represent the scene around you. Example - Output from a LiDAR or RGB-D Camera."

    "#### Common Geometric Formats\n",
    "1. PCD - Can save only point clouds. Can also save extra information like color of points and normal or each point.\n",
    "2. PLY - Can save Polygon meshes as well as Point cloud. Also saves color and normals and optionally faces created by triangles.\n",
    "3. STL - Saves Triangular Mesh and contains only triangular faces. (This does not have any color or texture.)\n",
    "4. OBJ - Used to meshes that has texture. It is mostly accompanied by .MTL file that defines material, color that will be accompanied by another .png file if we need to have that texture in the model.\n",
